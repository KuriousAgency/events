# Event Model

When you're on a single event template, or looping through events using `craft.events.events()`, you're actually working with a `Events_EventModel`. This in turn extends Craft's [Element Criteria Model](https://craftcms.com/docs/templating/elementcriteriamodel) object.

## Simple Output

Outputting a `Events_EventModel` object in your template without attaching a property or method will return the eventâ€™s name:

`<h1>{{ event }}</h1>`

Event Models have the following attributes and methods:

## Attributes

The id of the event.

### eventType
