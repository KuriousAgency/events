# Ticket Model

Events contain multiple tickets. When you're looping through available tickets using `craft.events.tickets.eventId(event.id)`, you're actually working with a `Events_TicketModel`. This in turn extends Commerce's [Purchasable](https://craftcommerce.com/docs/purchasables) object.

## Simple Output

Outputting a `Events_TicketModel` object in your template without attaching a property or method will return the ticketâ€™s name:

`<h1>{{ ticket }}</h1>`
