## Installation

1.  [Download the latest version](/craft-plugins/events/pricing) of Events and unzip.
2.  Copy the `events/` directory into your `craft/plugins/` directory.
3.  Inside the Craft control panel, navigate to _Settings â†’ Plugins_.
4.  Locate the row showing the Events plugin and click _Install_.

## Settings/License

With Events installed, you will be able to acess the plugin settings. Here you can enter the license key for using Events and get access to general settings.

In the **General Settings** section you can adjust the _SKU Length_. Ticket SKU's are generated automatically when you add a [Ticket Type](/craft-plugins/events/docs/feature-tour/ticket-types) to an event and when this ticket is purchased.

- a [Ticket Type](/craft-plugins/events/docs/feature-tour/ticket-types)
